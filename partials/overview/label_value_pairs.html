            <div class="value">Robert "Bob" Belcher, Jr. is the husband of Linda, the father of Tina, Gene, and Louise, the son of Big Bob Belcher, and the main character of the series. He is a second generation restaurant owner, as his father owns a diner, and currently the proprietor of his eponymous burger restaurant in an as-yet-unidentified Northeastern United States shore town. His childhood has been described as "crappy," as his father discouraged play. While poor with business management, and cursed with an unlucky streak, his skills at burger cooking have been shown to be excellent, to the point where he has been referred to as a "beef artist".</div>
